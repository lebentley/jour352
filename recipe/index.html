    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bananas: Mash three large, ripe bananas. You should have 1 1/3 cups (11 ounces) of mashed bananas total.
        </li>
        <li>Flour: You’ll need 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Baking Powder and Baking Soda cause the bread to rise and makes it more tender.</li>
        <li>Salt improves the flavor and texture and balances the sweetness.</li>
        <li>Coconut Oil: Just two tablespoons of coconut oil adds some moisture while keeping the bread light. You can
            also swap this for butter or vegetable oil, if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar: I used Lakanto monkfruit for a healthier option, but light brown sugar will also work.</li>
        <li>Egg: You’ll need one large egg.</li>
        <li>Applesauce: Unsweetened applesauce replaces most of the oil.</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract for flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep: Preheat the oven to 350°F, and grease an 8×5-inch loaf pan with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Dry Ingredients: Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.</li>
        <li>Wet Ingredients: Cream the coconut oil, applesauce, and sugar with a stand or hand mixer. Add the egg and
            vanilla and beat at medium speed until thick. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine: Add half of the dry ingredients and blend on low speed until combined. Pour in the remaining flour
            mixture and the mashed bananas and blend on low, ensuring you don’t overmix.</li>
        <li>Bake: Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake on the center rack for 45 to 50 minutes or until a
            toothpick comes out clean but moist.</li>
        <li>Serve: Let the pan cool for at least 10 minutes, then turn it over to remove the loaf from the pan. The
            bread should be at room temperature before slicing to ensure it doesn’t fall apart.</li>
        <li>Let pan cool at least 10 minutes, bread should be room temperature before slicing</li>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>How to ripen bananas quicker</h3>
    <p>Place bananas in a paper bag and leave them in a warm area for quicker ripening. When the peels get spotted and
        blacken slightly, and become soft they will be ready.</p>
    <h3>How to store banana bread</h3>
    <p>Once the bread cools, store it in an airtight container for one day on the counter and then in the fridge for up
        to a week.</p>
